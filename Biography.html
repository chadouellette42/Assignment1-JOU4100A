            <p>"Hi, I'm Chad and I've wanted to be a writer for as long as I can remember, not necessarily journalism, I always thought I was going to be scientist or a psychologist, but as an author or technical writer. I was born in Ottawa, Ontario and I have never moved from this wonderful city. As a child, and early into my adult life I participated in organized sports which took up the majority of my time.After a devestating knee injury when I was 20, I had a lot of spare time and, with that time, my pursuit for a career began. </p>

            <p> My pursuit began at Rochester Adult High School, where I needed to go in order to attain some needed math and science credits (I was going to be a biologist of course) and after six months, my creative writing professor told me I should be a journalist because of my varied interests. What she told me turned on a lightbulb, and that night I applied for the Journalism program at Algonquin College.   </p>
            <p>I can honestly say that Algonquin helped shape me into the person I am today. From the moment I entered my first class, everything changed. I was in a place where I could not only learn from some of the best people, but meet and connect with many others. My love for journalism really peaked when I became managing editor of the Algonquin Times. I learned that being in a newsroom is an amalgamation of wonderful ideas, different personalities and writing styles, and amazing people with a story to tell. The best part about it is that everyone is in it to tell spread truth and accuracy to the public.I even managed to be awarded the Journalism Program Award there, and be chosen to be the co-editor-in-chief of sweat magazine. </p>

            <p>Since Algonquin, I've worked in marketing, interned in communications, and I am currently a national correspondent for USports, which is the national governing body ofuniversity sport in Canada. I currently live with my fiancee, and I am in my final year of University studying Digital Journalism at OttawaU. </p>
